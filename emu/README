First version of streamIO with HDF5. Multi-threaded streaming threads with IO thread. HDFIO performed by IOthread in background. Reads and writes are interleaved. 

Event generator creates events at rate specified by user. Events are buffered, sorted and stored in NVRAMs. NVRAM data are written to file blocks. HDF5 metadata contains b-tree for file blocks. 
Files and buffers can be probed for most recent events by submitting queries. Queries have higher priority over file block writes. 
All IO are parallel IO performed by MPIO collectives using HDF5 metadata for lookups.

Consistency of queried data is maintained by HDF5, IO thread priorities, and locks. The NVRAM view returned by probes is a global view of data sorted across multiple NVRAM files. HDF5 view returned by queries is sorted data across multiple disk blocks. Data in memory buffers is not globally sorted.
